              You should occasionally keep track of your weight in order to
              monitor your development. Your weight changes everyday as a result
              of uncontrolled variables like water, thus we advise once a week.
              We recommend starting your daily weight-checking routine early in
              the morning, just before breakfast.
            </p>

            <p>
              Taking measures will help you track your progress even more
              effectively since even while your body will get more tonedÂ as a
              result of fat loss and muscle growth, your weight may remain the
              same or even rise during this time. We advise collecting
              measurements every two to four weeks.
